# k-NN Implementation on Wine Dataset

This project implements the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm from scratch and applies it to classify wines from the UCI Wine Dataset.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## Installation
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
1. Run the Jupyter notebook `analysis.ipynb` for the complete analysis.
2. Or import `knn.py` to use the KNN class in your own projects.

## Results
- Achieved ~94% accuracy with k=3 using Euclidean distance.
- Manhattan distance performed slightly worse (~89% accuracy).
- Optimal k value was found to be 3-5.
